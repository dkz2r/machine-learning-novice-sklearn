# Unsupervised learning

In episode 2 we learnt about supervised learning. Now it is time to explore unsupervised learning. 

Sometimes we do not have the luxury of using labelled data. This could be for a number of reasons:

* We have labelled data, but not enough to accurately train our model
* Our existing labelled data is low-quality or innacurate
* It is too time-consuming to (manually) label more data
* We have data, but no idea what correlations might exist that we could model!

In this case we need to use unsupervised learning. As the name suggests, this time we do not "supervise" the ML algorithm by providing it labels, but instead we let it try to find its own patterns in the data and report back on any correlations that it might find. You can think of unsupervised learning as a way to discover labels from the data itself.

# Clustering

Clustering is the grouping of data points which are similar to each other. It can be a powerful technique for identifying patterns in data.
Clustering analysis does not usually require any training and is therefore known as an unsupervised learning technique. Clustering can be applied quickly due to this lack of training.

## Applications of clustering
* Looking for trends in data
* Reducing the data around a point to just that point (e.g. reducing colour depth in an image)
* Pattern recognition

## K-means clustering

The k-means clustering algorithm is a simple clustering algorithm that tries to identify the centre of each cluster.
It does this by searching for a point which minimises the distance between the centre and all the points in the cluster.
The algorithm needs to be told how many k clusters to look for, but a common technique is to try different numbers of clusters and combine
it with other tests to decide on the best combination. 

> ## Hyper-parameters again
> 'K' is also an exmaple of a *hyper-parameter* for the k-means clustering technique. Another example of a hyper-parameter is the N-degrees of freedom for polynomial regression. Keep an eye out for others throughout the lesson!

### K-means with Scikit-Learn

To perform a k-means clustering with Scikit-Learn we first need to import the sklearn.cluster module.

~~~
import sklearn.cluster as skl_cluster
~~~
{: .language-python}

For this example, we're going to use Scikit-Learn's built-in 'random data blob generator' instead of using an external dataset. Therefore we'll need the `sklearn.datasets.samples_generator` module.

~~~
import sklearn.datasets as skl_datasets
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now lets create some random blobs using the `make_blobs` function. The `n_samples` argument sets how many points we want to use in all of our blobs while `cluster_std` sets the standard deviation of the points. The smaller this value the closer together they will be. `centers` sets how many clusters we'd like. `random_state` is the initial state of the random number generator. By specifying this value we'll get the same results every time we run the program. If we don't specify a random state then we'll get different points every time we run. This function returns two things: an array of data points and a list of which cluster each point belongs to.

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    """
    # Extract the x and y coordinates from the data
    tx = data[:, 0]
    ty = data[:, 1]
    
    # Create a figure with a specified size
    fig = plt.figure(1, figsize=(4, 4))
    
    # Scatter plot the data points, coloring them by their cluster assignment
    # plt.scatter(tx, ty, s=5, linewidth=0, c=clusters)
    plt.scatter(tx, ty, c=clusters, cmap="nipy_spectral", edgecolor='k')
    
    # Loop through cluster centers and mark them with a red 'x'
    for cluster_x, cluster_y in Kmean.cluster_centers_:
        plt.scatter(cluster_x, cluster_y, s=100, c='r', marker='x')
    
    # Display the plot
    plt.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Lets create the clusters.

~~~
N_true_clusters = 4
data, cluster_id = skl_datasets.make_blobs(n_samples=400, cluster_std=0.75, centers=N_true_clusters, random_state=1)
plots_labels(data, cluster_id)
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Plot of the random clusters](../fig/random_clusters.png)

Now that we have some data we can try to identify the clusters using k-means. First, we need to initialise the KMeans module and tell it how many clusters to look for. Next, we supply it with some data via the `fit` function, in much the same way we did with the regression functions earlier on. Finally, we run the predict function to find the clusters.

~~~
N_pred_clusters = 4
Kmean = skl_cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=N_pred_clusters)
Kmean.fit(data)
clusters = Kmean.predict(data)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The data can now be plotted to show all the points we randomly generated. To make it clearer which cluster points have been classified we can set the colours (the c parameter) to use the `clusters` list that was returned by the `predict` function. The Kmeans algorithm also lets us know where it identified the centre of each cluster. These are stored as a list called 'cluster_centers_' inside the `Kmean` object. Let's plot the points from the clusters, colouring them by the output from the K-means algorithm, and also plot the centres of each cluster as a red X.

~~~
plot_clusters(data, clusters, Kmean)
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Plot of the fitted random clusters](../fig/random_clusters_centre.png)

Here is the code all in a single block.

~~~
import sklearn.cluster as skl_cluster
import sklearn.datasets as skl_datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data, cluster_id = skl_datasets.make_blobs(n_samples=400, cluster_std=0.75, centers=4, random_state=1)

Kmean = skl_cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=4)
Kmean.fit(data)
clusters = Kmean.predict(data)

plot_clusters(data, clusters, Kmean)
~~~

### Assessing cluster quality with the silhouette score
Evaluating the quality of clusters is a crucial step in clustering analysis, as it helps determine how well the data points fit into their assigned clusters. A widely used metric for this purpose is the **silhouette score**, which measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette score is defined for each data point and ranges from -1 to 1, where:

- **1** indicates the data point is well matched to its cluster and poorly matched to other clusters.
- **0** indicates the data point is on or very close to the decision boundary between clusters.
- **-1** indicates the data point may have been misclassified into the wrong cluster.

The silhouette score can be averaged across all data points to provide an overall measure of clustering quality. Additionally, examining silhouette scores for individual samples can help identify outliers or problematic clusters.

Here is the Python code to calculate both the overall silhouette score and the individual sample scores:

~~~
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score, silhouette_samples

# Calculate the overall silhouette score
overall_silhouette = silhouette_score(data, clusters)
print(f"Overall Silhouette Score: {overall_silhouette:.2f}")

# Calculate silhouette scores for individual samples
sample_silhouettes = silhouette_samples(data, clusters)
sample_silhouettes
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Exercise: How many clusters should we look for?
> Using k-means requires us to specify the number of clusters to expect. A common strategy to get around this is to vary the number of clusters we are looking for, and use the silhouette score to select the most appropriate number of clusters.
> Use the code below to loop through searching for between 2 and 10 clusters, generating silhouette plots for each. Which (if any) of the results look more sensible? What criteria might you use to select the best one?

> > The silouette score, unfortunately, incorrectly identifies N=2 as the most approprirate clustering configuration in this case (silhouette = 0.73). However, the silhouette score for N=4 (true cluster number) is very close (silhouette = 0.72). The silhouette can act as a useful guide in selecting cluster number, but it doesn't always produce perfect results. Clustering with different feature sets or exploring different clustering algorithms may yield better results.

### Limitations of k-means

* Requires number of clusters to be known in advance
* Struggles when clusters have irregular shapes
* Will always produce an answer finding the required number of clusters even if the data isn't clustered (or clustered in that many clusters)
* Requires linear cluster boundaries

![An example of kmeans failing on non-linear cluster boundaries](../fig/kmeans_concentric_circle.png)


### Advantages of k-means

* Simple algorithm and fast to compute
* A good choice as the first thing to try when attempting to cluster data
* Suitable for large datasets due to its low memory and computing requirements


> ## Exercise: K-Means with overlapping clusters
> Adjust the program above to increase the standard deviation of the blobs (the cluster_std parameter to make_blobs) and increase the number of samples (n_samples) to 4000.
> You should start to see the clusters overlapping.
> Do the clusters that are identified make sense?
> Is there any strange behaviour?

## Spectral clustering

Spectral clustering is a technique that attempts to overcome the linear boundary problem of k-means clustering.
It works by treating clustering as a graph partitioning problem and looks for nodes in a graph with a small distance between them. See [this](https://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/education/graduate/spectral-clustering/SC_course_part1.pdf) introduction to spectral clustering if you are interested in more details about how spectral clustering works.

Here is an example of spectral clustering on two concentric circles:

![Spectral clustering on two concentric circles](../fig/spectral_concentric_circle.png)

Spectral clustering uses something called a 'kernel trick' to introduce additional dimensions to the data.
A common example of this is trying to cluster one circle within another (concentric circles).
A k-means classifier will fail to do this and will end up effectively drawing a line which crosses the circles.
However spectral clustering will introduce an additional dimension that effectively moves one of the circles away from the other in the
additional dimension. This does have the downside of being more computationally expensive than k-means clustering.

![Spectral clustering viewed with an extra dimension](../fig/spectral_concentric_3d.png)

### Spectral clustering with Scikit-Learn

Lets try out using Scikit-Learn's spectral clustering. To make the concentric circles in the above example we need to use the `make_circles` function in the sklearn.datasets module. This works in a very similar way to the make_blobs function we used earlier on.

~~~
import sklearn.datasets as skl_data

circles, circles_clusters = skl_data.make_circles(n_samples=400, noise=.01, random_state=0)
plots_labels(circles, circles_clusters)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The code for calculating the SpectralClustering is very similar to the kmeans clustering, but instead of using the sklearn.cluster.KMeans class we use the `sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering` class.
~~~
model = skl_cluster.SpectralClustering(n_clusters=2, affinity='nearest_neighbors', assign_labels='kmeans')
~~~
{: .language-python}

The SpectralClustering class combines the fit and predict functions into a single function called fit_predict.

~~~
labels = model.fit_predict(circles)
plots_labels(circles, labels)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here is the whole program combined with the kmeans clustering for comparison. Note that this produces two figures. To view both of them use the "Inline" graphics terminal inside the Python console instead of the "Automatic" method which will open a window and only show you one of the graphs.

~~~
import sklearn.cluster as skl_cluster
import sklearn.datasets as skl_data

circles, circles_clusters = skl_data.make_circles(n_samples=400, noise=.01, random_state=0)

# cluster with kmeans
Kmean = skl_cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=2)
Kmean.fit(circles)
clusters = Kmean.predict(circles)

# plot the data, colouring it by cluster
plot_clusters(circles, clusters, Kmean)

# cluster with spectral clustering
model = skl_cluster.SpectralClustering(n_clusters=2, affinity='nearest_neighbors', assign_labels='kmeans')
labels = model.fit_predict(circles)
plots_labels(circles, labels)
~~~

> Modify the program we wrote in the previous exercise to use spectral clustering instead of k-means and save it as a new file.

Machine learning is a set of techniques that enable computers to use data to improve their performance in a given task.
This is similar in concept to how humans learn to make predictions based upon previous experience and knowledge. Machine
learning encompasses a wide range of activities, but broadly speaking it can be used to: find trends in a dataset,
classify data into groups or categories, make predictions based upon data, and even "learn" how to interact with an
environment when provided with goals to achieve.

We will cover the basics of machine learning using the [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Python package,
a popular library for machine learning in Python. Scikit-Learn provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and
tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

:::::: prereq

Participants will be assumed to have a basic understanding of Python. You should have a basic understanding of how to
run Python code in a Jupyter Notebook, and be able to write for loops, conditional statements, use functions, and
import libraries.
